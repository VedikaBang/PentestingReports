# WHY THIS REPO ?ü§Ø
1. As a VAPT intern, which is an abbreviation for Vulnerability assessment and Penetration testing, finding vulnerabilities isn't enough. 
   There's much more to that. And this documentation is about what I learnt as an intern and recapitulation of VAPT.
2. Honestly, I enjoyed diligently. It's conspicuous, because I love finding bugs, playing CTFs and the most important, while finding a bug/Flag, The process one goes through!
3. It's exhilarating and prolific. One might argue, because it's very subjective. For instance, looking at a command line blankly, as if a car ran over your cat, and realizing you never had a cat in a first place! (Funny?) , and suddenly finding a clue after enumerating few commands, written in C/Python, and ending up learning how PDFs are made literally!
4. I don't know about you, but learning how touchscreen works- was way too overwhelming for me. I am not sure which problem led me to that video but Jeez! It's miraculous and cannot be expressed in words. 
5. Well, this might look as a frivolous to some, because you end up investing more time than you were supposed, anyhow you learn ! And that's (I) count for something.
6. Do I espouse "Jack of all trades, and master of none ?". I don't really know. And that seems like another colloquial for someday.

### How VAPT works?üßê
1. I won't be drawing/presenting any flowcharts. Because, I am not a connoisseur, also this is not a blogging site, DUH!. However, I would like to edify someone who is trying to cut into the field with what I have learnt.
2. Information Gathering : Information gathering isn't stalking. Information gathering in VAPT, for a scope, I consider as the very imminent step after knowing the scope.
3. Field is FOSS! Analyzing gathered information, making sure it's correct is a precedence. Detecting the vulnerability upon gathering the information, following report analysis.
4. DOCUMENTING : I know, (even I used to think who cares when you already found the Pot! )But at [WattleCorp Cybersecurity Labs](https://www.wattlecorp.com/), I not only learnt how to detect the vulnerabilities but
why is it important to document them in a organized way. You know how they say , "You ain't a writer, if there isn't a reader", likewise, reporting is one of those many crucial things. One needs to write in a comprehensive way to make sure whatever you are trying to imply, isn't misconstrued. hence, this repository! (Links for every boxes are provided!)
5. Every step is a direction towards a rabbit hole.(It surely is a prolific ride! ) Tip: Try on VulnHub to institute stronger foundation.   

If you need any help, regarding the documentation or pentesting, I'd like to aid in :)
